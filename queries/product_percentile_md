# Product Sales Percentile Ranking

## Problem
The sales department wants to understand how products rank in terms of total revenue performance, so they can target marketing campaigns for the top percentile performers.

## Goal
Assign percentile rankings to products based on their total revenue.

## Query
```sql
WITH total_revenue AS (
  SELECT 
    p.product_id, 
    p.product_name, 
    SUM(od.unit_price * od.quantity * (1 - od.discount)) AS total_sales
  FROM products AS p
  JOIN order_details AS od ON p.product_id = od.product_id
  JOIN orders AS o ON od.order_id = o.order_id
  GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
)
SELECT 
  *, 
  ROUND(CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY total_sales DESC)::numeric, 2) AS sales_percentile
FROM total_revenue;
```

## Result
![Product Percentile](../images/product_percentile.png)
